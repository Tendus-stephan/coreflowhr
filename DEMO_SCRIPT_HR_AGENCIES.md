## CoreFlowHR Demo Script for HR & Recruitment Agencies

**Target audience**: Small recruitment agencies, internal HR at SMEs  
**Goal**: Show how CoreFlowHR saves time and automates the hiring process in **3–4 minutes**.

---

## Demo flow (3–4 minutes)

### 1. Opening (15 seconds)

Spoken (or TTS) line:

> “I’ll quickly show you how CoreFlowHR helps agencies and in‑house HR teams manage candidates with less manual work, from outreach to hiring.”

---

### 2. Jobs & candidates in one place (30–40 seconds)

**What to show**
- Open the `Jobs` page.
- Show 1–2 active jobs.
- Click into one job and show the list of candidates.

**What to say**

> “Here’s where you manage all your open roles. When candidates come in — from LinkedIn sourcing, your website, or direct applications — they’re attached to the right job and show up here automatically. Everything is in one place instead of scattered across spreadsheets and inboxes.”

**Key message**: *Centralized jobs and candidates, no spreadsheets.*

---

### 3. AI outreach + registration link (≈45 seconds)

**What to show**
- Open a candidate in the `New` stage.
- Open the candidate profile.
- Click the action to generate an outreach / screening email.
- Show the AI‑generated email and the registration link.

**What to say**

> “Instead of manually writing the same outreach email over and over, CoreFlowHR generates a personalized message for each candidate in seconds. It includes a unique registration link so they can continue the process themselves, without you having to set up anything manually for them.”

**Key message**: *10 minutes of manual outreach becomes 10 seconds with AI.*

---

### 4. Candidate registration & CV upload (30–40 seconds)

**What to show**
- Open the registration link in a new tab (candidate view).
- Show the registration form.
- Navigate to the CV upload page.
- After “submitting”, flip back to show the updated candidate profile.

**What to say**

> “When a candidate clicks the link, they land on this simple registration page, then upload their CV. CoreFlowHR turns that into a structured candidate profile automatically, so candidates do the data entry and you just get clean, usable information — not a pile of PDFs.”

**Key message**: *Candidates self‑serve; you get structured data automatically.*

---

### 5. Candidate pipeline / Kanban board (≈45 seconds)

**What to show**
- Go to the `Candidate Board`.
- Show the columns: `New → Screening → Interview → Offer → Hired` (and `Rejected` if relevant).
- Drag a candidate from `New` to `Screening`, and optionally `Screening` to `Interview`.

**What to say**

> “This is your pipeline view. Every candidate is in exactly one stage, so at any moment you can see how many people are in New, Screening, Interview, Offer, and Hired. Moving someone forward is as simple as dragging and dropping them to the next column.”

**Key message**: *Visual, drag‑and‑drop pipeline instead of tracking status in your head.*

---

### 6. Automated workflows on stage change (≈30 seconds)

**What to show**
- After moving a candidate, briefly mention the workflow.
- Optionally, open the `Email Workflows` page for 5–10 seconds.
- Optionally, show a notification / activity log item.

**What to say**

> “Behind the scenes, stage changes can trigger workflows. For example, when I move someone into Screening, CoreFlowHR can automatically send them a screening email. When I move them to Interview, it can send interview confirmation. You set the workflows once, and every candidate gets a consistent, timely experience.”

**Key message**: *Set it once, and follow‑ups happen automatically when stages change.*

---

### 7. Dashboard overview (optional, 20 seconds)

**What to show**
- Open the main `Dashboard`.
- Show metrics: active jobs, total candidates, and recent activity/notifications.

**What to say**

> “From the dashboard, you get a quick snapshot of how many roles are active, how many candidates are in the system, and what’s been happening recently. You don’t need to dig through every job to know what’s going on.”

**Key message**: *At‑a‑glance visibility into your whole recruiting operation.*

---

### 8. Closing (15–20 seconds)

**What to say**

> “That’s the core of CoreFlowHR: AI‑powered outreach, self‑service registration and CV upload, a visual pipeline, and automated workflows on every stage change. The result is less manual admin, more consistent candidate communication, and the ability to handle more roles with the same team.”

Optional final line:

> “If you’d like, I can set this up with your own roles and a sample pipeline so you can see it with your data.”

**Key message**: *Time saved → more placements and better candidate experience.*

---

## Short 2‑minute script (for very quick demos)

You can use this as a tight, 2‑minute voiceover:

> “Here’s how CoreFlowHR helps agencies and internal HR teams manage candidates with less manual work.  
>  
> First, all your jobs live here. When candidates come in — from LinkedIn, your website, or direct applications — they’re attached to the right role so everything is tracked in one place instead of in spreadsheets.  
>  
> Let’s open a candidate. With one click, CoreFlowHR generates a personalized outreach email and includes a unique registration link. Instead of typing the same message 50 times, you approve it once and send.  
>  
> When candidates click the link, they register and upload their CV. The system creates a structured profile automatically, so you’re not copying and pasting from PDFs.  
>  
> This is your pipeline. You can see who’s New, who’s in Screening, who’s in Interview, Offer, and Hired. Moving someone forward is as simple as dragging and dropping them to the next stage.  
>  
> And when you move a candidate, CoreFlowHR can automatically send the right email for that stage — for example, a screening email when they enter Screening, or an interview confirmation when they enter Interview.  
>  
> So instead of spending hours on admin and follow‑ups, you get a clean pipeline, automated communication, and more time to actually talk to the best candidates.”
