# How to Pay for Google Gemini API

## Quick Answer

**Google Gemini API uses a "pay-as-you-go" model:**
1. You get a **free tier** (generous limits)
2. Once you exceed free tier, you're automatically charged
3. Payment is via **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) billing**

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Get Your API Key (You Already Have This)

You already have your Gemini API key from:
- https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

This key is set in your `.env.local` as `VITE_API_KEY`.

### Step 2: Set Up Billing Account

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console:**
   - Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Sign in with the same Google account you used for the API key

2. **Create/Select a Project:**
   - If you don't have a project, create one
   - Or select an existing project

3. **Enable Billing:**
   - Go to **Billing** → **Link a billing account**
   - If you don't have a billing account:
     - Click **Create Billing Account**
     - Enter your payment information (credit card)
     - Complete the setup

4. **Enable Gemini API:**
   - Go to **APIs & Services** → **Library**
   - Search for "Generative Language API" or "Gemini API"
   - Click **Enable**

### Step 3: Set Up Billing Budget (Recommended)

To avoid unexpected charges:

1. **Go to Billing → Budgets & alerts**
2. **Create a budget:**
   - Set a monthly spending limit (e.g., $50)
   - Add email alerts at 50%, 90%, 100% of budget
   - This will notify you before you spend too much

### Step 4: Monitor Usage

**Check your usage:**
- Go to **Google Cloud Console** → **APIs & Services** → **Dashboard**
- Look for "Generative Language API" usage
- See real-time usage and costs

**Or via API:**
- Go to **Billing** → **Reports**
- Filter by "Generative Language API"

## 💰 Pricing & Free Tier

### Free Tier (What You Get for Free)

**Gemini 2.0 Flash:**
- **15 requests per minute (RPM)** - Free
- **1 million tokens per day** - Free
- **After that:** Pay-as-you-go pricing

**For your use case** (recruitment emails):
- ~500 input tokens + ~300 output tokens per email
- **Free tier covers ~1,400 emails per day** (1M tokens ÷ 800 tokens/email)
- That's **~42,000 emails per month FREE!**

### Paid Pricing (After Free Tier)

**Gemini 2.0 Flash:**
- **Input:** $0.075 per 1 million tokens
- **Output:** $0.30 per 1 million tokens

**Example Costs:**
- 1,000 emails = ~$0.15 (if you exceed free tier)
- 10,000 emails = ~$1.50
- 100,000 emails = ~$15.00

**Most users won't exceed the free tier** unless you have very high volume!

## 📊 How Billing Works

   - Any usage above the free tier
   - Applied to your linked payment method
3. **Invoice generated** monthly
4. **Auto-charge** to your payment method

## 🎯 Cost Control Tips

### 1. Set Up Budget Alerts
- Get notified at 50%, 90%, 100% of your budget
- Prevents surprise charges

### 2. Monitor Usage Regularly
- Check your usage dashboard weekly
- Spot any unusual spikes early

### 3. Optimize Usage
