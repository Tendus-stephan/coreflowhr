## 🎯 Best Approach: Pre-Staged Demo Data

### **Option 1: Use Pre-Registered Candidate (Recommended)**

**Setup (Before Demo):**
1. Create a test job and source candidates
2. Generate an outreach message for one candidate
3. **Register the candidate yourself** using the registration link:
   - Copy the registration link from the outreach message
   - Open it in incognito/private window
   - Enter a test email (e.g., `demo@example.com`)
   - Submit registration
4. This moves candidate to "Screening" stage automatically
5. Check that Screening email was sent (or manually verify in email history)

**During Demo:**
1. Show candidate in "New" stage → Generate outreach message
2. **Quick transition:** "I'll show you what happens when they register..."
3. Switch to the same candidate (now in "Screening" stage)
4. Show email history → "See, CV upload email was sent automatically"

**What to Say:**
- "When I generated this outreach message earlier, the candidate clicked the registration link"
- "Let me show you the same candidate now - notice they've moved to Screening automatically"
- "The system sent them a CV upload email automatically"

---

### **Option 2: Use Multiple Candidates (Show Before/After)**

**Setup:**
1. Have 2 candidates for the same job:
   - **Candidate A:** Still in "New" stage (hasn't registered yet)
   - **Candidate B:** Already in "Screening" stage (pre-registered)

**During Demo:**
1. **Show Candidate A (New stage):**
   - Open their profile
   - Show "Outreach" section (no email)
   - Generate outreach message
   - Explain: "This is what you send on LinkedIn"

2. **Switch to Candidate B (Screening stage):**
   - "Now let me show you what happens after registration..."
   - Open Candidate B's profile
   - Show they have an email
   - Show email history → CV upload email sent
   - Point out: "This candidate registered earlier, so they're already in Screening"

**What to Say:**
- "Here's Candidate A - they just got the outreach message"
- "And here's Candidate B - they registered yesterday"
- "See the difference? After registration, everything is automated"

### **Option 3: Simulate Registration in Real-Time (Advanced)**

**Setup:**
1. Have a test email ready (e.g., `demo@coreflowhr.com`)
2. Have the registration link ready in another tab
3. Use screen split or multiple browser windows

**During Demo:**
1. Generate outreach message for a candidate
2. Copy the registration link (show it in the message)
3. **Say:** "Now, when the candidate clicks this link, let me show you what they see..."
4. Open registration link in new tab/window
5. Fill in registration form with test email
6. Submit
7. **Quickly switch back** to candidates page
8. Refresh or navigate to candidate
9. Show they moved to "Screening" stage
10. Show email history (may take a moment to appear)

**Pro Tips:**
- Have the registration link copied in advance if possible
- Use incognito window for registration to avoid session conflicts
- Keep both windows visible side-by-side if screen size allows

**What to Say:**
- "Let me simulate what the candidate sees..."
- "I'm entering my email as if I'm the candidate..."
- "Watch what happens when they submit..."

### **Option 4: Screen Recording/Video (For Complex Demos)**

**Setup:**
1. Pre-record the full flow:
   - Generate outreach message
   - Show registration page
   - Complete registration
   - Show candidate moving to Screening
   - Show email being sent
2. Save video file (keep it under 2 minutes)

**During Demo:**
1. Generate outreach message live
2. **Say:** "Here's a quick video showing the complete flow..."
3. Play pre-recorded video
4. Return to live demo

**Advantages:**
- Smooth, no waiting
- Shows complete flow without interruption
- Professional presentation

### **Option 5: Show Registration Page Directly (Quick Method)**

**During Demo:**
1. Generate outreach message for a candidate
2. Copy the registration link
3. **Say:** "When candidates click this link, they see this..."
4. Navigate directly to registration page (paste link in new tab)
5. Show the registration form (don't submit)
6. **Say:** "They enter their email here..."
7. Switch back to candidates
8. Show a candidate who already registered (in Screening stage)
9. **Say:** "After registration, they automatically move here and receive the CV upload email"

**What to Say:**
- "This is the registration page candidates see"
- "Once they enter their email, the system automatically moves them to Screening"
- "Let me show you what a registered candidate looks like..."

## 🎬 Recommended Demo Script (LinkedIn Outreach Flow)

### **Step-by-Step Script:**

**1. Introduce the Challenge (30 seconds)**
> "One of the key features is how we handle candidate privacy. When we source candidates from LinkedIn, they don't have email addresses - this is by design for compliance. Let me show you how we contact them first via LinkedIn."

**2. Show New Candidate (1 minute)**
- Navigate to Candidates page
- Open a candidate in "New" stage
- Point out: "Notice - no email address. This is normal."
- Go to Email tab → Point out "Outreach" section

**3. Generate Outreach Message (1 minute)**
- Click "Generate Outreach Message"
- Show the AI-generated message
- **Highlight the registration link in the message**
- Click "Copy Message to Clipboard"
- **Say:** "I copy this and paste it on LinkedIn when messaging the candidate"

**4. Transition to Registered Candidate (1-2 minutes)**
- **Say:** "Now, when the candidate receives this on LinkedIn and clicks the registration link, here's what happens..."
- Navigate to or switch to a candidate in "Screening" stage (pre-registered)
- **OR:** Show registration page directly

**5. Show Registration Page (1 minute)**
- Paste registration link or navigate to registration page
- Show the form: "Candidate enters their email here..."
- Point out job/candidate info displayed
- **Say:** "This is a secure, tokenized link - only works once"

**6. Show After Registration (1-2 minutes)**
- Go back to candidate who registered
- Show they're now in "Screening" stage
- Open Email tab → Show email history
- Point out: "CV upload email sent automatically"
- **Say:** "All of this happens automatically - candidate registers, moves to Screening, receives CV upload email"

**7. Wrap Up (30 seconds)**
> "This privacy-first approach ensures we're compliant while still automating the workflow once candidates opt-in by registering their email."

## 💡 Key Talking Points During Outreach Demo

### **Emphasize:**

1. **Privacy & Compliance:**
   - "We can't legally scrape emails from LinkedIn"
   - "This respects candidate privacy and GDPR compliance"
   - "Registration is opt-in - candidates choose to share their email"

2. **Seamless Automation:**
   - "Once they register, everything is automated"
   - "No manual work needed after the initial LinkedIn message"
   - "System handles stage movement and email sending"

3. **Professional Outreach:**
   - "AI generates personalized outreach messages"
   - "Messages include a secure registration link"
   - "You maintain personal connection through LinkedIn"

4. **Workflow Requirement:**
   - "Important: You must create a Screening workflow first"
   - "This ensures candidates receive CV upload emails after registration"
   - "System will remind you if it's missing"

## 🛠️ Quick Setup Before Demo

### **5-Minute Pre-Demo Prep:**

1. **Create Test Candidate Setup:**
   ```
   - Source candidates for a demo job
   - Pick one candidate to pre-register
   - Generate outreach message for that candidate
   - Copy the registration link
   - Register the candidate yourself (use test email)
   - Verify candidate moved to Screening stage
   - Check email history shows CV upload email
   ```

2. **Have Ready:**
   - Registration link copied (for showing registration page)
   - Test email address (if simulating registration)
   - Candidate in "New" stage (to generate outreach)
   - Candidate in "Screening" stage (to show after registration)

3. **Verify:**
   - Screening workflow is enabled
   - Email templates are set up
   - No error messages in candidate modal

## 🎥 Alternative: Screen Split Demo

If you have a large screen or dual monitors:

**Layout:**
- **Left Side:** Main application (candidates, jobs, etc.)
- **Right Side:** Registration page or email client

**Advantages:**
- Show both sides simultaneously
- No tab switching needed
- More visual impact

**During Demo:**
1. Generate outreach message on left
2. Show registration link
3. Open registration page on right (don't submit yet)
4. Explain the flow while both are visible
5. Switch to registered candidate on left
6. Show email on right (if email client)

## ⚡ Quick Answer: What If They Ask to See It Live?

**Response Options:**

1. **"I've pre-registered this candidate to show you the complete flow. In a real scenario, this happens when the candidate clicks the link from LinkedIn. Would you like me to simulate it with a test email right now?"**

2. **"Great question! Let me show you the registration page they see when they click the link. I can either show you a previously registered candidate, or simulate the registration process now with a test email. Which would you prefer?"**

3. **"I can show you both - here's the registration page, and here's what happens after they register. Would you like me to complete a test registration now so you can see it in real-time?"**

## 📝 Sample Dialogue Flow

**You:** "Let me show you how we contact candidates who don't have emails yet."

*[Navigate to Candidates → Open candidate in New stage]*

**You:** "Notice this candidate has no email - that's normal for sourced candidates. When I go to the Email tab..."

*[Click Email tab, show Outreach section]*

**You:** "...I see this Outreach section. Let me generate a LinkedIn message."

*[Click Generate Outreach Message]*

**You:** "The AI creates a personalized message with this secure registration link. I copy this and paste it when messaging them on LinkedIn."

*[Copy message, then switch to registered candidate]*

**You:** "Now, when the candidate clicks that link and registers, watch what happens. Here's the same candidate after they registered..."

*[Show candidate in Screening stage with email]*

**You:** "They automatically moved to Screening, and the system sent them a CV upload email. All automated after that initial LinkedIn message."

**Choose the technique that works best for your demo style and technical setup!** The key is being transparent about simulating the registration while showing the real automation that happens afterward.
